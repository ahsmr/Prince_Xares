### Shop Feature
- The bot includes a **shop system** where admins can select a channel for the shop.
- The shop automatically creates **two messages**:
  1. **Pouch Shop** â€” Users can buy pouches using **Crystara** currency.
    - Visual Example : <img width="1069" height="503" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35bb9553-9bd8-4563-8eaa-85c43f587804" />
  2. **Role Shop** â€” Users can purchase roles using either **Crystara** or **coins**.
      - Visual Example :
        <img width="1103" height="806" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49bc56ad-c9ad-4475-b94d-7da3c2096896" />
        <img width="1100" height="595" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feb197fa-8c87-4819-ba09-ce57b73c74fa" />


        
- This setup allows users to interact with the shop messages to make purchases directly.

### Notes:
- Some subcommands require additional parameters such as:
  - `user` â€” Target another userâ€™s vault (admin permissions required).
  - `id` â€” Specify the coin ID for actions like level up or removal.
  - `view` generates a dynamic image showing coins with stats and the userâ€™s profile picture.


## ðŸ–¼ Vault System

Vaults are represented as in-memory image files generated dynamically using `BufferedImage`. No file writes or persistent image caching are used â€” everything is built and sent in real-time with profile pictures and layout logic.(All the images are AI generated)

Example output (visualized):
